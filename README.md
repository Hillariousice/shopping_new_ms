## NODE JS APP => MICROSERVICES
   This is a practical example of NodeJS Microservices Architecture. I built a simple Online Grocery Shopping Application using ES6 in a Monolithic way and segregate in Microservices Architecture without impact frontend. So each individual services will work independently to server the purpose and business logic. This is a simple app but the microservice architecture is highly advance. I will be using some advance tools

## PRODUCT ORDER APPLICATION

  ## Functional Requirement

  -  Listing of available products
  -  User signup/ signin
  -  Add product to cart
  -  Add product to Wishlist
  -  Place an order
  -  View an order

## Importance of Microservice Architecture
-  Unlike the monolith aproach each service are independent of each other meaning if one service crashed the other still continue to work e.g There was a time watsapp status was not working and other stuff was working and user can still access the app. That is because it is built using microservice architecture
-  Easy to develop with less dependency and also to deploy
- with microservice you can achieve a losely coupled code instead of tightly coupled code
- With microservice you can use the CQRS pattern.CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security.

- it easy to scale services and feature using the microservice
